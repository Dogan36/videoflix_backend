# Videoflix Backend Repository

**Videoflix Backend** is the server-side component of the Videoflix fullâ€‘stack streaming application, developed as part of the Fullâ€‘Stack training at Developer Academy. It provides RESTful APIs for movies, user authentication, streaming, progress tracking, and asynchronous video processing tasks.

## Features

- **User Management**: Registration, email verification, login (Token authentication), password reset.
- **Movie Catalog**: CRUD views for movies, categories, and progress entries.
- **Video Streaming**: Rangeâ€‘request support for efficient streaming at multiple resolutions.
- **Progress Tracking**: Endpoints to record and retrieve playback progress and completion status.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: RQâ€‘based tasks to convert videos into multiple resolutions, generate thumbnails, extract trailers, and compute durations automatically upon upload.
- **Roleâ€‘based Access**: Authenticated endpoints with permissions for public or protected resources.
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Home endpoints and "load more" APIs support page sizes based on client needs.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for models, serializers, views, tasks, signals, and utilities (achieving over 80% coverage recommended).
